            As part of our final group project at Code Institute, we
            embarked on this journey to redefine task management with MIMO, which was successfully completed on October
            10, 2024. <br><br>

            Our diverse skills in development, design, and vision came together to create a tool that helps users stay
            organized and productive. We are committed to continuous improvement, always striving to provide the best
            experience for our users. Together, we believe in making task management not only easier but also more
            enjoyable.</p>
